[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dmbarra/practicingSeleniumProject.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dmbarra/practicingSeleniumProject)

<br>


**All features and scenarios for test are:**<br> 
_'../resources/\*.features'_

**Automation test:**<br> 
_I wrote automation in JAVA + Selenium + testNG.<br>_
_My choice for use RemoteDrive was to avoid problems with environments. I'm using BrowserStack with my personal account.<br>_
_I use PageFactory to register page components_ <br>
_I use travisCI to run test on every commit_<br>


**Run automation:**<br> 
_To authenticate on BrowserStack, you need to create two local variables on your system, <USERNAME_BROWSER_STACK> and <KEY_BROWSER_STACK> with your credentials_<br>
